CA-125
[In cases of ovarian cancer, serum CA125 level may be elevated, but this marker has a low sensitivity in the early stages of ovarian cancer(only reported to be elevated in 23-50% of stage I cases)

- Early tumors often do not secrete significant levels of CA‑125, especially in younger, BRCA+ populations or non-serous histological types.

- Approximately 20% of EOC patients do not exhibit elevated CA125 levels, ](https://ovarianresearch.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13048-019-0503-7?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

[Increased CA125 levels are also reported in other physiological or pathological conditions, such as menstruation, pregnancy, endometriosis and inflammatory diseases of the peritoneu

- upper limit is 35 U/mL in pre and post-menopausal patients.

- the specificity of CA125 for detecting ovarian cancer was 78%
